## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

To capture attendance from a Zoom meeting:

1. **Join the Zoom Meeting in your browser**
   Ensure you're using the Zoom web client (not the desktop app).

2. **Keep the Zoom tab active**
   The extension will only work if a Zoom meeting is open in an active tab. If not, it will show an error:

   ![Not in zoom](https://github.com/abbasidaniyal/btt-lab-attendance/blob/main/images/not_in_zoom_status.png?raw=true)

3. **Click the Extension Icon**
   Once you're in the meeting, click the extension icon. It will confirm that you're currently in a Zoom session:
   
   ![In zoom](https://github.com/abbasidaniyal/btt-lab-attendance/blob/main/images/in_zoom_status.png?raw=true)

4. **Capture Attendance**
   Click on **"Capture Attendance"**. A CSV file will be automatically downloaded containing the current list of participants.
